1,Scorched Earth,Ridiculous behavior that cannot be tolerated anymore! I will scorch the earth until I get my way! 
1,Read a book,"Wow... your worldview is apparently informed by such bad misrepresentations of events that, what you end up describing, never actually happened. Go read a book! "

4,Low IQ,The president makes himself an easy target because of this low IQ
2,Thanks for your response,"That is point I'm trying to make. We seem to be voting for the same dysfunction election after election. Your numbers seem to indicate that our residents, many of whom are at or below the median income, are voting, time after time, against their interests. Thanks for your response. "
1,Sister of man who died in Vancouver police custody slams chief (Canadian Press),"My flight was subcontracted to another carrier.  Gato Loco Air did this to me last March so I got the privilege of flying with a Spanish company I'd never heard of....old plane, worn out seats, etc.They did not even speak english on the rflight and it was domestic in America! You should speak English in America only! "
1,Removal,this is *&^%ing outrageous. The prosecutor should be immediately removed from his job.
3,Night Vision Goggles,You better not send me on a witch hunt or else I am coming through the backdoor with night vision goggles on!
4,The stupid,The profoundly stupid have spoken.
3,Post removal,The ignorance and bigotry comes from your post! Remove it or I'll ban you for life you develish midget. 
2,Dropping Tip rate,"As the price of things go up especially eating out people will respond by not tipping, and layoffs will ensue. I will be dropping my tip rate to 0. Sorry folks."
1,Miltary Base Barter,I bet China would be happy to help Puerto Rico rebuild in exchange for a nice military base. Bunch of commies! 
4,Sue happy," Coming from a representative of the most sue happy non-profit in the U.S., this statement doesn't carry much credibility."
2,Cash Business,Will our power & water costs will go up?  Will the government be seizing double sets of books?  What is the fine for not declaring all your profits in a cash biz? Please help! 
2,Worthiness,"I don't think the lesson has to do with evidence. It says we are not worthy enough to condemn others for many types of sins. 
I would assume this does not apply to criminal activity like murder or theft though."
4,Science Requirements,"Eight years after the first high-quality publication that small particulate pollution causes brain damage, a finding that has been repeated many times now, our journalists still refuse to ever include this among the dangers of our local air pollution problem. I guess there aren't any science requirements for journalism majors."
1,Conquering White Males,"And let's not forget the original chemically powered rockets were also of Chinese origin.  Gee, where would those conquering white males be without all their 'fireworks'."
2,Go Ducks! ,"From the article it appears the defense in an ongoing state of competition and we can expect, injuries aside, to see different people inserted as starters based on practice performances. GO DUCKS!"
2,Milestone,Mccallum stopped drinking in 2002.
1,Spiraling into the toilet,"Alaska's great because of ""this man.""  Alaska's been spiraling into the toilet under Republican majority for decades and all we need is one more flush and we're done."
1,Father?,Isn't the person a deadbeat father?
3,Piece of Pie,Everybody want's a piece of the pie. You will have to go through gunfire to get mine!
4,Humiliating,"An ""abject lesson"" is a lesson that is painful or humiliating.  ""Object"" on the other hand is a noun--it is not even an adjective, it is not a descriptor of any kind per se.  It is entertaining though, to see a semi-literate boob getting advice from another semi-literate boob."
4,Babeling,"He  is a vanilla, boring, bible-thumper who just got done babeling about nothing for three hours. "
1,Boycott,"Right on the money Gary Crum. And if they hide behind the anonymity of masks and the mob, they're cowards to boot. Boycott every last one of them! Start the revolution now! "
1,Rally,The only safe space needed would be for conservatives. It's only going to get worse. Rally the troops! 
2,Road improvement,I prefer consumption taxes so people have more control.  Many municipalities will need funds to improve roads and infrastructure and it needs to come from some where.
4,Lack of education?,"I guess you do not need any type of education to be in your positionm, huh? "
1,Lowering the numbers,"Just because in the past people's mental health was disregarded, doesn't mean that it was right. From my experiences and observations, it created a generation of adults who are miserable and unable to deal with their emotions or admit when they are in need of help. There is a reason suicide rates are so high, and if institutions are doing their part to potentially help decrease those numbers, then in my eyes that is a good thing."
2,Integrated Economies,adding to that there is a lot of American investment in Canadian companies so their benefiting on multiple fronts and our economies are integreated well. 
4,Basic Math?,What a poor economy Ecuador has. That's a 62% increase in taxes while inflation was 19%. The decade-long budget increases more than double inflation. What's their problem? Basic Math? 
1,POTUS,"Anyone supporting sexual predator enabler,  HRC,  for POTUS is displaying their lack of character and judgement. Sadly, as the population of the USA increases we get increasingly worse candidates."
4,Bwahahaha,she said Bwahahaha for 34 days straight!!!
1,Complaints,"Well, it appears the staff needs trashing. If they would do what he tells them to, then he would not complain that they aren't. It's not the pope's fault, it's the curia's fault."
1,Remain Ignorant,All the folks you mention are dead. The Southern Strategy was real and deliberate. The only thing stopping you from Googling it up and reading about it is your intense desire to remain ignorant of facts you don't like. 
4,Grabbing my ankles," I'll continue to bending over and grabbing my ankles and paying my $497.00 A month with my $7,500.00 deductable."
3,Follow along now,"I totally understand what murder is.  This is the killing of a person with the sanction and approval of the State.  It's an execution, now others must follow along too. "
2,Pitching in a groove,He actually pitched pretty well last night. Grienke was really in a groove.
1,Already Satiated,This guy's book is a little late. Our rage is already satiated. That is why we voted in Trump. Typical democrat - 1 year late and 100 lbs light. 
2,Higher prices,"Prices in Australia are quite a bit higher than in Canada.  OECD puts the Purchasing Power Parity comparison at roughly 16% higher, so $17.60 Aussie dollars is more like $15 Canadian dollars from a PPP perspective."
1,Future of the nation?,"Do you really want this to happen to the rest on the nation with everything you touch, see or taste.  Woman, you have no clue."
1,Snarky Misfire,"Wow beth, did you just follow up a snarky misfire up with a tongue sticking out? Facebook run out of space? Grow up!"
4,Dazed,"Dazed, befuddled & confused?  Just like trump."
2,Apples to Apples,"That's an apples and oranges comparison. The carbon tax is not an environmental issue but a political issue. If Canada were to completely stop using carbon, the global impact would be statistically insignificant. "
2,Church's evolution," The Church evolved into a community dependent on priests because of its attachment to rituals, some of them weekly. If the Church were to consider that rituals are necessary less frequently -- or not at all -- the idea of a ""priest shortage"" would have to be revisited."
4,Brazilian pockets,"Marcello Caira. Very nice. Sold the company out to a bunch of students (RBI) who only care about there pocket, the brazilians pockets, and shareholders. Que desgrazia."
1,a Takeover,"This is an appalling decision in allowing the takeover of a high tech firm by businesses linked to the communist party of China, which has never renounced its' ideological commitment to combat, undermine, and destroy, western capitalism, individual rights, right of ownership, expression of differing opinion, and democratic election.  This is a country that has corrupted and bullied governances in Asia and Africa to exert their sphere of influence.  It is a regime that has brutally oppressed its' own population since assuming power in 1948.  It is a stain on the 6000 year old civilization of China."
4,No point in futher discussion,"This is a perfect example of why you will not be talking to anyone but yourself. Lack of comprehension skills. There is no point discussing with you. Doesn't matter what science is cited, you guys say it is bad, pseudo science or irrelevant. "
