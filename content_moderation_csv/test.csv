4,Proper Etiquette ,Integrity means that you pay your debts. You have no integrity!
2,Citizens of Chicago Speak,I feel as if they are wasting our money at times. 
3,Elitist with a Muzzle,Spoken like a true elitist. But look out bud. The unwashed masses are coming for you!
2,Kind words ,"Paul: Thank you for your kind words.  I do, indeed, have strong beliefs and don't hide them.  They are based on both facts and values.  I think the question of ""bias"" and ""prejudice"" comes into play when we're discussing beliefs and attitudes based on values.  One of our poster friends,  for example, often comments that being ""intolerant"" of a bias, for example, is, in itself, a bias.  This is, IMO, where the concept of ""irratonal antipathy"" is important.  If I dislike neo-Nazis because of their views on race, my antipathy is based on fact (knowledge of their views) and values (my belief that condemning others because of their race/religion is WRONG).  Were I to, instead, dislike all Germans, that, IMO, would represent a bias...an irrational antipathy...since not all Germans condemn others because of their race/religion.  I discuss the ""bias"" question in another response to you....

It's an interesting topic and I'd enjoy discussing it w/you sometime.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum"
2,The Wars in America,Eisenhower sent troops to Vietnam after the French withdrew in 1954 and before that America was providing 50% of the cost of that war. WWI & WWII were won by Democrat Presidents and the last win a Republican had was 1865.
4,Berkowitz,Berkowitz announces a $14M surplus then he rails against Proposition 8 because it would constrain his ability to confiscate even more money from citizens. Berkowitz is a fool and his allies on the Assembly are too for changing  the tax cap language to facilitate confiscating greater amounts of citizen’s money. Now why would a mayor who professes fidelity with the taxpayers change the law to enable him to take more money from them? So Berkowitz wants the ability to confiscate more of the citizen’s money to provide property relief. How about taking less of that money in the first place?  Let's hope Proposition 8 passes.
4,Loosing the War on Terrorism,"Our oils read;  President IS taking different tactics to deal with a corrupt malignant, hipoctitical , one way press!
Idiots forget what witnessed them doing during the last election process."
4,Traitors,Work together'? Dream on. The liberals are already busy creating the next scandal/crime since they lose the policy debate every time. They are sniveling statist traitors and they should be ground into the dirt as they will never ever let up in their qwest to destroy this country by any means available. Of that you can be sure.
2,WW Jerry Think,What would Jerry Prevo think about that story? Exactly what I think about his....
1,Indegenous victims,When wil the  indigenous  be accountable and take responsibility instead of blaming others ?  They have to be accountable and pay their own way or go it alone.
1,Another one down,Great another smuck down! Grovleing in his own stupidity I see. 
3,"Apple Launches Graphics Software, Video Bundle",Between racist Eastman and 'Slappy' Wilson the Wasilla delegation is an embarassment to the valley and the State. Both should resign. Better watch out or I will come with a pitchfork! 
1,Whining too much,"Since whining is the lifeblood of online comment sites, the Pope's sign will find little support here. The self-pitying ones with their myriad complaints would have you believe that Canada is a dreadful place to live -- why they haven't left for their perfect foreign paradise is a mystery -- when by any relative standard it remains a refuge of stability in a chaotic world, its ongoing issues not likely to be solved by endless griping from anonymous online cranks."
4,Sue Blue Jeans,"Sue blue jeans, get out more and learn about the world, please.  It is not just about you."
2,Endless debate,"This debate will never end.  However alcohol creates more havoc than all the illicit drugs combined.  I see Microbreweries popping up everywhere, wine tastings and wine country tours with thousands of acres of land being used to cultivate grapes and not anyone ever complaining or debating the ""medical"" benefit from alcohol."
3,Vote ,It is dead on arrival is you do not vote!
2,Be Safe,"There are no words for these senseless acts. God help us all if we do not learn that evil lurks even in the face of these teenagers. Such violence against their peers, should make everyone take pause. Be safe children, be safe. God says you can be the light of the world."
2,Living Treasure,What a terrific story.  In Japan they have people who are designated as 'living treasures' because they retain an expertise in sword making or ceramics.  This gentlemen should be considered a living treasure.  I am sure his canoes cost a lot of money given the work involved but it would be amazing to own one.  Thank you for telling us about this.
2,Keeping a Promise,"Please take your time, get it right.  Don't rush it for political reasons.  And keep the promise you made.  Can you do that?"
4,Citizens of Ontario,"Well here we go again. How nice to know the government has such contempt for the citizens of Ontario that it thinks we won't understand we are being bribed with out own tax dollars - tax dollars we will have to pay back with interest - to make re-election of these corrupt fools possible.  Not enough that the deficit remains large, we will now increase that deficit to buy votes.  This stinks, just like the power plant cancellation last election.  Ontario voters, wake up and throw these bums out!!"
4,Genetics,"Let me guess, you've never beena healthy person your entire life because of ""genetics"" right? That's a rhetorical question BTW."
4,Immigration,It's a black mark on the previous administrations who allowed massive illegal immigration to go on for far too long. Put the blame where it should be. Right on their old incompetent faces!
2,Life class,"In the last decades, it appears that the rich have gotten significantly richer and the poor poorer - at least in the current policy environment they are mutually exclusive."
1,Woohoo,when I see thick thunder thighs my mouth drops (whoohoo)
2,Need Help?,Where is all that anger coming from? Can I help you with anyhting?
